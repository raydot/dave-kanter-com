# DaveKanter.com

This is a portfolio website for [DaveKanter.com](http://www.davekanter.com).  

It's built in [Gatsby](https://gatsby.js) V2 using [gatsby-starter-dimension](https://github.com/codebushi/gatsby-starter-dimension) as a template.

The front-end world changes fast!  You will need to `nvm use 12` to run this repo.

## Lessons Learned Building this Site
It's not the most uncommon thing for people who work in web development to put their own development needs last.  I started this portfolio site in September 2019 because I wanted to represent myself with a React / Netlify presence online.  I chose to use [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) because I had used it in another project and it looked promising, and picked a an [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/) Gatsby template that looked like it could be easily modified to come up with a decent design.  

I put the site together slowly over the process of a few months, taking time to add custom photos, but got really stuck on the Portfolio section.  It required me to take a deeper dive into Gatsby's `gatsby-image` than I was able to commit to at the time, and so I put up a "Portfolio Coming Soon Page" instead.  Sure!  I'll get right back to it!  

Two-and-a-half years have passed and I'm just now getting back to it.  Over the last two-and-a-half years I've learned a __LOT__ more React and Javascript, and Gatsby, Node, React have each jumped 2-3 major semantic versions in both scale and scope.  

What this has meant, is, I've had to _unlearn_ a ton of best practices to go back to a point where I can develop with this out-of-date environment.
