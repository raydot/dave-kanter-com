# Welcome!

This is my new development blog where I'll be sharing:

- **AI/ML Engineering**: Building production AI systems, working with LLMs, and learning ML fundamentals
- **Web Development**: Modern React patterns, Next.js best practices, and frontend architecture
- **Technical Leadership**: Leading teams, mentoring developers, and bridging technical and business stakeholders

## What to Expect

I'll be documenting my journey as I transition from frontend development to AI/ML engineering, sharing:

- Real-world project experiences (like building VoterPrime's AI system)
- Technical deep-dives and architecture decisions
- Lessons learned from 20+ years in tech
- Teaching and mentorship insights

## Stay Tuned

More posts coming soon! Follow along as I explore the intersection of web development and artificial intelligence.
