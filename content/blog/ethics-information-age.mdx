# Ethics in the Information Age

## The Problem

Over the past few years I've been noticing more and more that the Information Age seems to have lost its way. It certainly is not the Information Age I looked forward to as a child, where information would be at your fingertips at the touch of a button. It certainly is not the Information age I started helping to build in the late 90's, where "content is king" and "quality over quantity" were the watchwords. Not to mention Google at the time still believe in the simple idea of "Don't be evil."

It seems there are two primary conclusions the dominant in technology have reached:

1. The more money you make the more right you have to rule over the norms of society.
2. The sole purpose of the greatest communication platform the world has ever known is to sell advertising -- as much as possible to anyone who can be reached.

Not so long ago, neither of these things were true. Today "Maximizing shareholder value" is taken as gospel, "Government is the problem" is accepted without question, "The free market will solve everything" is the default economic model, and "there's nothing you can do about it" is the accepted response.

This puts technologies in an unenviable position.

In my youth I started and stopped a graduate program in media studies. As fascinated as I was by the ideas put forward by thinkers like Roland Barthes and Marshall McLuhan, I didn't really feel we were using the correct conculsions from what they said. There was a sort of breathlessness that was expected to accompany these big ideas, and if you didn't get it it's just because you didn't understand yet, but given time the truth would be revealed. I seriosly doubt too many people came out of that program with the knowledge required to prositively impact the future. What I suspect many of them did was take their degrees to Publishing and Advertising agencies, attempting to turn their master's theses into marketable ideas. I also suspect that very few of them succeeded.

What this has to do with "ethics" is that what happened instead is that these idealistic views became roadmaps to what not to do, and compliance was bought with corner-offices and seemingly lofty salaries. Never mind that the real money was being made somewhere else. It was the end of the 60's dream expressed by Kalinga, the husband of Jan Brady in _I'm Gonna Git you Sucka._ "We went down to [take over the government] but they were hiring that day. The brothers walked in with guns -- came out with jobs." Of course the revolution won't be televised. Because brother, you know nothing about running a television station.

We were given a recent ethics training and work that emphasized over and over that anything that so much as smelled like a conflict of interest was undesirable. That the very appearance of impropriety was to be avoided at all costs. That same day the news reported that the Quatari government had gifted the president of the United States a $400 million dollar aircraft to be used as the next Air Force One. The question of whether or not this was a bribe was simply played off with the glib answer that the aircraft would be donated to the Presidential Library at the end of the term. How is my conception of ethics supposed to be reconciled what that very idea?

There's no way the US healhcare system would be what it is if it truly answered to the free market proposed by Adam Smith. Heck, not even the cable companies would exist. Instead, prevailing forces have convinced us all that we ourselves have made the choice to be spied on, to allow for economic collusion, to support corruption at the highest levels of governent, and for power to be concentrated in the hands of a few. Heck, we use their products! We buy their goods! We work for the! We vote for them! It's not their fault things are this way -- it's ours.

And looking back it's clear to me that I was 100% complicit in this. I didn't scoff at the notion of privacy being dead. I didn't push back and what I knew to be misrepresentations of the facts. I didn't run for office, encourage people to vote, or create my own platform to change the world. I just went along with it and I didn't even get the corner office.
